This is a sample project for creating web app and adding the possibility to gather
test coverage of integration tests executions using Jetty, Sonar, Jacoco and Maven
build system. So it can be successfully run on CI system.

ACTORS:

1. jacoco-maven-plugin - instruments classes on the fly and expose system property,
which can be consumed by other processes to generate execution dump.
2. jetty-maven-plugin - Jetty is used as container to run our REST web app
3. maven-failsafe-plugin - runs our ITs

See pom.xml for details.

PS. Sorry for pushing .idea stuff, I think there is no reason to watch commit history,
hence I didn't bother myself.
